# Northcoders News API

Hello, and welcome to my first project - Northcoders-News-API!

To get started and connect to the dev and test databases please add .env.test and .env.development to the root of this repo.

In each file please add "PGDATABASE=nc_news_test" and "PGDATABASE=nc_news" respectively to be able to run this project locally.
