# Northcoders News API

Hello, and welcome to my first project - Northcoders-News-API!

## Description
This project is a RESTful API designed to provide access to a database containing news articles, topics, user information, and comments. It includes features for interacting with the data, such as adding new comments and upvoting or downvoting articles. Comprehensive error handling has been implemented to ensure robust functionality. The development process was driven by TDD and integrated testing, ensuring reliability and precision in all features. Detailed examples of request methods for each endpoint are documented in the endpoints.json file.

## Hosted API
Check out my hosted API: https://northcoders-news-api-7cgk.onrender.com/api (Please allow up to 1 minute of loading time!)
Try adding these endpoints to the end of the url: 
                                                    1) /api/articles (this will show all articles in reverse chronological order)
                                                    2) /api/topics (all topics)
                                                    3) /api/articles/1 (this will show the article with an id of 1)
                                                    
All possible endpoints can be found in the original link: https://northcoders-news-api-7cgk.onrender.com/api
